For my Aresty research, I have designed and trained a convoluted neural network that achieved an accuracy of 95.6% in identifying potential porosity and irregular density given a 40 x 40 melt pool temperature map. Under Professor Guo, I analyzed over 70 million metal laser 3D printing temperature maps to augment new datasets that accentuate melt pool features. For example, this is the approximate outline of the melt pool.
